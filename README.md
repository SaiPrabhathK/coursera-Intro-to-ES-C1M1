> This repository contains C source code that performs statistical analysis, such as, finding the maximum, minimum, mean, median and sort the given dataset in decreasing order.

The Header file ***stats.h*** contains the function prototypes and their documentation.

The Implementation file ***stats.c*** contains *main()* along with other required functions such as:
 - *print_statistics()* - A function that prints the statistics of an array including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
 - *print_array()* -  Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen
 - *find_median()* - Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value
 - *find_mean()* -  Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean
 - *find_maximum()* -  Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum
 - *find_minimum()* -  Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum
 - *sort_array()* - Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from largest to smallest.  (The zeroth Element should be the largest value, and the last element (n-1) should be the smallest value.)
